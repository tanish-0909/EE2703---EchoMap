# EE2703---EchoMap
This is a project which simulates an array of the sound sensors for obstacle detection and imaging

1. First I simulate how a waveform will look given the known location of the obstacle
2. Then I simulate where the obstacle will be given the time sampled waveform in an array of mics.

The step by step instructions and details are given in the ipynb file. And all necessary details are covered in the pdf file
